Welcome to Day 13 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Console Object Methods**.

The `console` object in JavaScript provides various methods for logging, debugging, and interacting with the browser console. Common methods include `log` for general logging, `error` for error messages, `warn` for warnings, and `info` for informational messages. Additionally, `group` and `groupEnd` create collapsible groups for organized logging, while `table` formats data into a table. These methods empower developers to effectively analyze and troubleshoot code during development.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day13/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/13_Day_Console_object_methods/13_day_console_object_methods.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.
