Welcome to Day 12 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Regular Expressions**.

**Regular expressions (regex)** are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation in JavaScript. They define search patterns for strings, enabling tasks like validation, extraction, and substitution. With their concise syntax, regex provides a flexible and efficient way to handle text-based operations, enhancing string processing capabilities in JavaScript applications.
