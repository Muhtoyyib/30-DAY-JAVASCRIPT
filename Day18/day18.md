Welcome to Day 18 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Promises**.

**Promises** are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Introduced to handle callback hell, promises simplify asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable. A promise can be in three states: *pending*, *fulfilled*, or *rejected*. It allows developers to attach callbacks for success or failure, enabling better error handling and sequential execution. Promises are integral to modern JavaScript, facilitating efficient handling of asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from APIs or handling timeouts.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day18/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/18_Day_Promises/18_day_promises.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
