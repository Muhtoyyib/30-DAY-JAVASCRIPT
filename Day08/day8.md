Welcome to Day 8 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Objects**.

**Objects** are fundamental data structures in JavaScript, representing collections of related data and behavior. They consist of key-value pairs, where keys are properties or methods, and values can be any data type. Objects enable the organization and manipulation of complex data, making them essential for modeling real-world entities in JavaScript applications, from user profiles to complex data structures.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day8/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/08_Day_Objects/08_day_objects.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
