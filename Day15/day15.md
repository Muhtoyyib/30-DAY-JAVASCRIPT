Welcome to Day 15 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Classes**.

**Classes** in JavaScript are blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and methods. Introduced in ECMAScript 2015, they provide a more straightforward syntax for implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. With the `class` keyword, developers can define constructors, methods, and inheritance, fostering a more structured and reusable codebase. Classes enhance code organization and promote the creation of modular, maintainable, and scalable applications in the JavaScript language.
