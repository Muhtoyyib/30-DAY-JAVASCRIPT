Welcome to Day 10 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Sets and Maps**.

**Set**: A collection of unique values, ensuring no duplicates. Ideal for managing lists of distinct elements.

**Map**: A data structure that holds key-value pairs, allowing efficient data retrieval. Enables easy association between data and corresponding values.

Both **Sets** and **Maps** enhance data management and manipulation in JavaScript, offering specialized solutions for unique scenarios and relationships within applications.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day10/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/10_Day_Sets_and_Maps/10_day_Sets_and_Maps.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
