Welcome to Day 11 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Destructuring and Spreading**.

**Destructuring**: Extracts values from arrays or objects into distinct variables, enhancing code readability and simplifying data manipulation.

**Spreading**: Unpacks elements from arrays or properties from objects, promoting concise and expressive syntax. It facilitates the merging of arrays, objects, or function arguments.

Destructuring and spreading contribute to clean, efficient, and expressive JavaScript code, allowing developers to work with complex data structures more intuitively.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day11/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/11_Day_Destructuring_and_spreading/11_day_destructuring_and_spreading.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
