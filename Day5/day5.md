Today, we're diving into **Arrays**.

**Arrays** are versatile data structures that store collections of values, allowing you to group and manipulate data efficiently. They can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, and objects. Arrays offer numerous methods for adding, removing, and modifying elements, making them essential for organizing and processing data in JavaScript applications
