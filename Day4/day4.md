Welcome to Day 4 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Conditionals**.

**Conditionals** in JavaScript, like if statements and switch statements, control the flow of a program. They enable decisions based on specific conditions, allowing you to execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false. Conditionals are fundamental for building dynamic and responsive applications.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day4/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the<a href="(https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/04_Day_Conditionals/04_day_conditionals.md" target="_blank"> introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
