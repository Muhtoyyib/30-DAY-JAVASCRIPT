Welcome to Day 22 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Manipulating DOM Object**.

On day two of exploring the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, the focus is on creating, manipulating, and removing HTML elements using JavaScript. The `document.createElement()` method is introduced for creating elements, with an example showcasing the creation of an h1 element. To create multiple elements, a loop is utilized to assign values to different properties of the HTML object. Appending a child element to a parent element is demonstrated using `document.body.appendChild()`. Additionally, the process of removing child elements using `removeChild()` is explained, with an alternative method using the innerHTML property to clear all child elements effectively.
