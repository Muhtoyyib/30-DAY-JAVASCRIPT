Welcome to Day 7 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Functions**.

**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They encapsulate logic and promote modularity in JavaScript. Functions take input (parameters) and return output (values). They can be invoked multiple times, making code more efficient and readable. Functions are fundamental for organizing, structuring, and enhancing the functionality of JavaScript programs.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day7/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/07_Day_Functions/07_day_functions.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
