Welcome to Day 17 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Web Storages**.

**Web storage** provides a way for web applications to store data locally on a user's browser. In JavaScript, two main mechanisms exist: **localStorage** and **sessionStorage**. **localStorage** stores data persistently across browser sessions, while **sessionStorage** is session-specific, clearing data when the session ends. Both offer a simple key-value pair interface and allow developers to store and retrieve data efficiently. Web storage is commonly used for caching, session management, and enhancing the user experience by reducing server requests and providing quick access to locally stored information.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day17/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/17_Day_Web_storages/17_day_web_storages.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
