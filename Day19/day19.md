Welcome to Day 19 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Closures**.

JavaScript **closures** are a powerful feature allowing functions to retain access to variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing. A closure is created when a function is defined within another function, creating a lexical environment that preserves the state of local variables. This enables the inner function to reference and manipulate those variables, even outside its original context. Closures are crucial for creating private variables, encapsulating functionality, and implementing design patterns like the module pattern. They contribute to the flexibility and elegance of JavaScript, facilitating the creation of more modular and maintainable code.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day19/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/19_Day_Closures/19_day_closures.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
