Welcome to Day 21 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Document Object Model (DOM) - Day 1**.


On day one of learning the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, we explore how an HTML document is represented as a JavaScript object. Elements can be manipulated using various methods to access, create, append, or remove them. Techniques for selecting elements by tag name, class name, or ID are demonstrated, showcasing functions like `getElementsByTagName`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `getElementById`. Additionally, the `querySelector` method is introduced for versatile element selection. The tutorial covers adding and removing attributes, manipulating text content with `textContent` and `innerHTML`, and styling elements dynamically using JavaScript, emphasizing the camelCase notation for CSS properties in JavaScript.
