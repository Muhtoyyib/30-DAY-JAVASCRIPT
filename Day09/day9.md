Welcome to Day 9 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Higher-order Functions**.

**Higher-order functions** are functions that take other functions as parameters or return them. They facilitate abstraction and composition in JavaScript, allowing for concise and powerful code. Common higher-order functions include map, filter, and reduce, providing elegant solutions for array manipulation. By embracing higher-order functions, developers can write more declarative and expressive code, enhancing the functional programming paradigm in JavaScript.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day9/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/09_Day_Higher_order_functions/09_day_higher_order_functions.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
