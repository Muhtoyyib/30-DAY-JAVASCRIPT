Welcome to Day 6 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Loops**.

**Loops** are essential in programming for executing repetitive tasks. JavaScript offers several types, including `for`, `while,` and `do...while` loops. They allow you to automate processes, iterate through arrays, and perform actions multiple times. Loops help streamline code and are fundamental for building efficient and dynamic applications.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day6/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/06_Day_Loops/06_day_loops.md" target="_blank"> Introduction document</a>.

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
