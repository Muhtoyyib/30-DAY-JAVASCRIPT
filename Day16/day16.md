Welcome to Day 16 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **JSON**.

**JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation**, is a lightweight data interchange format. In JavaScript, it serves as a standardized way to structure data. JSON syntax resembles JavaScript object literal notation, making it easy to read and write. It consists of key-value pairs and supports nested structures. Commonly used for data exchange between a server and a web application, JSON's simplicity and universality contribute to its widespread adoption in modern web development. It seamlessly integrates with JavaScript, facilitating efficient data manipulation and communication.
