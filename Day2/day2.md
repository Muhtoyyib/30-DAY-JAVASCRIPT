Welcome to Day 2 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Data Types**.

JavaScript offers several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, and objects. These types enable you to store and manipulate different kinds of information in your code. Understanding data types is fundamental for effective programming in JavaScript, as it determines how data behaves and interacts within your applications.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day2/)folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the [introduction document](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/readMe.md).

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
