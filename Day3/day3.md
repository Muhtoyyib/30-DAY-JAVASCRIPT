Welcome to Day 3 of our 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! 

Today, we're diving into **Boolean, Operators, and Date**.

**JavaScript Boolean**: Booleans represent true or false values, essential for decision-making in code.

**Operators**: JavaScript offers various operators like arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to perform operations and comparisons between values.

**Date**: The Date object allows working with dates and times, enabling tasks like displaying current dates, calculating differences, and scheduling events in web applications.

Before you proceed to the [solutions](solutions-day3/) folder, make sure to review the essential concepts and exercises in the [introduction document](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/03_Day_Booleans_operators_date/03_booleans_operators_date.md).

Let's code, create, and conquer together 👨🏻‍💻🚀💪🏻!
